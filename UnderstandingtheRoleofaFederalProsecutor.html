<h1>Federal Public Defender: A Comprehensive Overview</h1>
2
<p>The role of a Federal Public Defender is critical in the American legal system, ensuring that individuals accused of federal crimes receive competent legal representation regardless of their financial status. This blog post delves into the intricate workings, history, challenges, and significance of the Federal Public Defender•s office.</p>

<h2>Understanding the Role of a Federal Public Defender</h2>
4
<p>Federal Public Defenders are appointed to represent individuals who are charged with federal offenses and cannot afford private legal counsel. These attorneys are crucial in maintaining the integrity of the legal process by upholding the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>
5

6
<p>Federal Public Defenders have a broad range of responsibilities, including:</p>

15
<h2>Historical Context</h2>
16
<p>The establishment of the Federal Public Defender•s office is rooted in the landmark decision of <i>Gideon v. Wainwright</i> (1963), where the Supreme Court recognized the right to legal counsel for defendants unable to afford an attorney.

22
</ul>
23
<h2>Challenges Faced by Federal Public Defenders</h2>
24
<p>Federal Public Defenders encounter numerous challenges that impact their ability to provide effective representation.</p>
25
<h3>Resource Limitations</h3>
26

27
<h3>Complexity of Federal Cases</h3>
28

Why CKEditor?
WYSIWYG editors in your software often misbehave. This is usually because they are out-of-date or simply are not reliable.

This leaves the end users frustrated.

However, both CKEditors are built with 16 years of experience in WYSIWYG rich-text editing by a team of 40+ developers. We consistently listen to user concerns, trends, new feature requests to help us build our editors. Architectures that can handle complex structures and the constant improvements makes the editors stronger than any other examples.

How to choose the perfect editor

Online HTML editor features
This section presents a whole variety of features that CKEditor has to offer
Styling and Formatting
The Basic Styles plugin provides the ability to add some basic text formatting to your document. It adds the Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Subscript and Superscript toolbar buttons that apply these styles. If you want to quickly remove basic styles from your document, use the Remove Format button provided by the Remove Format plugin.

Copy Formatting
The optional Copy Formatting plugin provides the ability to easily copy text formatting from one place in the document and apply it to another. To copy styles, place your cursor inside the text (or select a styled document fragment) and press the button or use the Ctrl+Shift+C keyboard shortcut.

Removing Text Formatting
The Remove Format plugin provides the ability to quickly remove any text formatting that is applied through inline HTML elements and CSS styles, like basic text styles (bold, italic, etc.), font family and size, text and background colors or styles applied through the Styles drop-down. Note that it does not change text formats applied at block level..

Autoformatting
The Autoformat feature in CKEditor 5 allows you to quickly apply formatting to the content you are writing. While it can be customized, by default it can be used as an Markdown alternative. For example you bold by typing **text** or __text__ , create bulleted lists with * or -, create headings with #, ## or ###.

Block-Level Text Formats
The Format plugin provides the ability to add block-level text formatting to your document. It introduces the Paragraph Format toolbar button that applies these text formats. The formats work on block level which means that you do not need to select any text in order to apply them and entire blocks will be affected by your choice.

Tables
This plugin adds the Table Properties dialog window with support for creating tables and setting basic table properties, such as: number of rows and columns, table width and height, cell padding and spacing, table headers setting, table border size, table alignment on the page and table caption and summary.

Inserting Images
The default Image plugin supports inserting images into the editor content. This plugin supports left and right alignment. It also allows setting image border as well as pixel-perfect alignment (by setting the horizontal and vertical whitespace). Links can be added to an image easily from the Image Properties dialog. A file manager such as CKFinder can be integrated for image upload and storage support.
